<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of VARS is to implement various VAR estimation and identification approaches, as well as inference tools.

## Progress

- [x] basic VAR model and VAR tools (IRF, FEVD, HDC)
- [x] classic VAR, i.e. OLS estimation, IV and recursive identification, bootstrap
- [x] bayesian VAR with (narrative) sign restrictions
- [x] add test data and code to the R package
- [x] add function and data documentation 

## Installation

You can install the development version of VARS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("GoldenBaozi/VARS")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(VARS)
## basic example code
## see /tests/testthat/test-bVAR.R
```
